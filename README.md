# Feature-Matchin-using-flann-and-brute-force-method
FLANN matching algorithm is uses k-nearest neighbour concept to find the best suitable match while comparing images or feature matching. I have used two method the brute matcher concept and the flann concept. Though flann is considered faster than brute matcher its efficiency does decrease with large datasets.
